Full Testimony:
Things Tiffany has them I’ve witnessed


	•	 fired me due to rumors and accusations of sexual assault, and talking poorly about ability where I worked at the time
	•	 When I addressed to her that her boyfriend who was also a brewer at the time, groped me, she said “do you blame him?“ “Have you seen yourself“ which I found would be very inappropriate
	•	Running the bar when she was drunk
	•	Falling over customers and sitting on their laps during business hours
	•	Keeping a staff member who has down syndrome late so he could dance for her drunk friends
	•	I received a call on one of my scheduled shift days, we are one of my coworkers informed me “Tiffany’s passed out“ and then been brought to my attention that Tiffany left employees who were lower functioning, autism, and other disabilities alone while she was passed out, drunk in front of customers
	•	Brought mail strippers into the brewery
	•	Close the business, so female strippers could be brought in to give an employee a lap dance
	•	Every shift I worked Tiffany was always drunk. There’s not been a day or a time. I can recall that she wasn’t drinking.
	•	I have seen her try to intimidate somebody off the street to come in to the business and cause chaos so I as a blind employee at the time could tease them
	•	I have seen her tip herself in her business partner out at the end of a shift
	•	Serves alcohol that she does not have a license for
	•	 I have heard her in her office talking bad about employees
	•	There has been many shifts, especially on the weekends, where Tiffany made it so she was the only one that could tip her employees out, but during those shifts, she was so drunk and couldn’t so I have gone a night without being tipped out
	•	She has tried to set me up on dates with older men that come into the bar
	•	As an employee working in customer service, my duties are to the customer and considering probability is an establishment to accommodate families, and one of all walks of life, I would take it upon myself to assist families with medically complex, children or little ones. I want particular evening. I brought one of the tablets over. to start a tab and take a family‘s order. Once all was done and I was headed back to the bar, she pulled me aside and said “what are you doing“ I asked her “what do you mean, I’m doing my job“ she then stated “ they need to come up to the bar like everybody else“ if he didn’t like that, I was taking the time to cater to the needs of a family and it wasn’t better fitting her
	•	She has tried to set me up with a police officer from the Inglewood Police Department
	•	She has driven me home drunk before I’m more than one occasion
	•	Tiffany lies about certain situations to make herself look good, but she genuinely pities the people she’s supposed to protect. There’s no level of protection, safety or concern for her staff. All she cares about is herself and drinking. I truly feel she opened a brewery so she could just serve herself and her friends alcohol.
	•	She uses the concept of a probability is supposed to stand for to make her look good when in all reality she manipulates uses and takes advantage of her staff.
	•	There’s no regard for the safety and well-being of staff. There’s no safety protocols put in place, nor does the staff know what to do in case of an
	•	Tiffany is a danger to her employees
	•	The whole purpose of probability in my eyes was intended to empower people disabilities and see that you can do more than just stock shelves are being in the back of a warehouse. Yet she treats them like babies. She belittle them. She makes them feel powerless and worthless. She has such a power over them that they feel what they’re given and being treated and how they’re being treated is normal, but it’s not. It’s despicable.
	•	Towards the end of my time as an employee probability, more and more negative kept happening. I didn’t like going into work anymore, but I did it to protect and be there for my coworkers who didn’t have a voice and couldn’t stand up for themselves.
	•	Tiffany puts on a face. To cameras and new stories she is the “and I’ll savior“ she is the voice for people at disabilities when it all reality it’s the complete opposite.
	•	I have personally witnessed Tiffany leave to go to the
To get more alcohol and leave her stuff without supervision
