Full Testimony:
Incident Notes – Brewability
	•	Inappropriate Religious Mockery:
Alyse a former manger placed “Black Jesus” figurines directly behind the bar, positioned immediately behind my regular workspace.
	•	Offensive Clothing at Religious Event:
During my Christian church party hosted at Brewability, Alyse wore a shirt reading “Jesus Is Rizzen,” a mocking alteration of “Jesus Is Risen,” implying sexual or disrespectful intent toward my faith and made sure we saw it. (Tiffany laughed at it)


	•	Sexually Explicit Conduct During Religious Event:
At the same Christian birthday party, female performers engaged in lap dances and strip-style behavior on the bar while my worship band getting ready to play and made them wait to play 
	•	This was the only time such conduct occurred in my seven years of employment.
	•	The event included children present, and Brewability is publicly advertised as a “family-friendly” environment providing board games and inclusive entertainment for all ages.


•	Religious Discrimination and Hostile Remarks by Management:
On one occasion, my mother was speaking with Morgan about the inappropriateness of a woman dancing on the bar during my party, especially given that children were present. In response, Morgan stated, “This is why I hate Christians,” implying that our concerns were due to our faith. This comment made me feel directly targeted for my Christian beliefs and contributed to my perception that previous and future negative treatment, discipline, or exclusion at Brewability was at least partially motivated by religious and political bias.

	•	Unauthorized Filming and Public Misrepresentation:
Management recorded video footage of employees, customers, and myself—without any written consent—and later published it on YouTube.
	•	One video depicted me, my mother, and my church community as “unfun” or antagonistic for objecting to the inappropriate on-bar dancing while children were present.
	

•	Targeted Provocation Based on Religious Beliefs:
AJ, a manager, knowingly asked if I wanted to place LGBTQ+ stickers on my shirt, despite being fully aware that my religious beliefs do not align with that message.
	•	Public Shaming and Professional Undermining:
Morgan reprimanded me in front of customers, stating, “It’s not your job to expose our policy changes,” after I charged her parents for their purchases according to the newly implemented policy Morgan introduced.
	•	I was following the new policy she (a director/ supervising manager) implemented personally; she claimed I made her parents “feel unwelcome.”
	•	The incident caused public embarrassment and questioned my professionalism in front of patrons and led to a meeting intended to shame me.


Incident: Retaliation and Inconsistent Enforcement of Political Expression and Morality Standards
	•	The situation originated when I wore a Charlie Kirk “Turning Point” hat to work.
	•	Management stated that political messages were prohibited in the workplace because they could “turn people off.”
	•	However, the hat was not intended as a partisan endorsement—it was worn to condemn political violence and to express that celebrating the death of any public figure is unacceptable.
	•	Shortly before the 2024 election, management placed Kamala Harris campaign stickers in the public restroom, encouraging customers to take and wear them.
	•	This directly contradicted the “no political messaging” policy and demonstrated an ideological double standard.
	•	Management was aware that I am a Republican, and the display made me feel targeted and mocked for my personal beliefs.
	•	Despite prohibiting any expression perceived as conservative, management regularly promotes and hosts ideologically aligned events, including LGBTQ+ programming such as drag-queen bingo and family drag-brunches.
	•	These events were initially open to minors, with children in attendance, and a 21-and-over policy was implemented only after approximately four such events.
	

•	Content and conduct during these events included:
	•	Adult-themed prizes such as sex toys awarded to bingo winners.
	•	Explicit sexual paraphernalia displayed on stage.
	•	Genitalia-shaped cakes served to attendees.
	•	Bags containing sexual materials distributed in exchange for donations.
	•	During one event, I personally received a homosexual pornographic DVD, after which I refused to participate in or work any further drag events.
	•	Management’s enforcement of its “non-political” rule is therefore inconsistent and discriminatory.
	•	Expression of Christian or conservative beliefs is restricted, while sexually explicit and politically charged content aligning with Democratic-party or progressive viewpoints is openly endorsed and encouraged.
	•	This has created an environment that is hostile toward employees of faith and incompatible with Brewability’s public representation as a “family-friendly inclusive establishment.”

Public Defamation of Caregiver (reported by customer): A customer informed my mother and me that Tiffany told them my mother has “Münchausen syndrome by proxy,” and similar statements were likely shared with other patrons. Tiffany knew my medical history (including an ICU admission after a thrombotic storm—blood clots in my brain, arms, and neck—and recurring inpatient chemo every six months), yet chose to spread a false, disparaging claim. This implied I am not genuinely ill and lack independent judgment, causing reputational harm to my mother, targeting me indirectly, and creating a hostile, humiliating environment—particularly damaging given my invisible disabilities and the stigma that already surrounds them.



	•	Strip-club outing initiated by Tiffany (safeguarding/financial-exploitation risk): In late October 2025, Tiffany proposed and organized an off-site visit to a strip club for several employees with developmental/intellectual disabilities. According to accounts relayed to me, at least one individual tipped a performer excessively, after which Tiffany/management paid the resulting bill. If accurate, this reflects serious lapses in duty of care (exposure to a sexually explicit venue, lack of documented guardian/caregiver consent or risk assessment, and foreseeable risk of financial exploitation).

•	Severe Intoxication of Management — Critical Safety and Wage Risk:
On one occasion at the end of my shift, I witnessed Tiffany so severely intoxicated that she lost consciousness (appeared passed out) inside the workplace, while her boyfriend—who was the acting brewer at the time—fell from his high-top chair due to apparent intoxication. Both individuals were solely responsible for handling the nightly tip-out process. As a direct result, neither I nor any other employee on duty was able to access our earned tips that night.
What’s more concerning, I was left in a position where I felt unable to leave, as I was genuinely worried about their immediate health and safety—including the possibility that they might not regain consciousness without assistance.
This incident created an environment of acute distress and vulnerability for all employees present, representing a grave failure of supervision, endangering both staff and management, and depriving workers of their rightful wages for the night.

•	Coercion and Exploitation of Employee with Down Syndrome:
On multiple occasions, I have personally witnessed Tiffany requiring my coworker Jose, who has Down syndrome, to perform dance routines at Brewability events—even when he clearly expresses that he does not want to participate. Tiffany consistently tells him, “It’s part of your job,” pressuring him to comply.
Most concerning, not long ago, Jose was instructed to perform a “Magic Mike”–style dirty dancing routine—an explicitly sexual dance that included giving lap dances to women and birthday guests. Despite Jose’s visible discomfort and repeated statements to others, including my mother (“I don’t like doing it”), Tiffany not only encourages but insists he perform this routine instead of his usual, less provocative Michael Jackson “Billie Jean” performance.
This ongoing pattern of forcing an employee with an intellectual disability to engage in sexualized entertainment, despite his objections, constitutes clear exploitation and raises serious safeguarding and ethical concerns.


•	Encouragement of Alcohol Use and Favoritism Toward Disabled Employees:
Tiffany routinely encourages employees with disabilities to drink alcohol with her during and after shifts. Those who participate and openly share her views are brought into her “inner circle,” receive preferential treatment, and are frequently showcased at events. Employees who do not engage, or who maintain differing values (such as myself), are excluded, overlooked, or penalized, regardless of work ethic or reliability. This has created an environment of favoritism, peer pressure, and increased risk for alcohol dependency among vulnerable individuals. Despite working at Brewability for seven years and rarely taking breaks, I repeatedly witnessed less dedicated staff who aligned personally with Tiffany being rewarded over harder workers.

⸻

	•	Unfair and Arbitrary Tip Distribution to Volunteers and Favorites:
When volunteers assist at Brewability, they are often included in tip-outs, even though this reduces the primary income of regular employees for whom tips are a critical revenue source. Tiffany unilaterally decides which volunteers receive tips, often favoring her friends or those who socialize with her over those who actually perform more work. For example, my mother frequently volunteered and worked harder than most, yet was never offered tips, while others who simply drank or socialized with Tiffany were rewarded. This untransparent and inequitable tip allocation undermines staff morale and creates financial hardship for those who depend on tips for their livelihood.

•	Political Commentary, Misinformation, and Deflection Using Industry Events:
Although enforcing a strict “no politics” policy in the workplace, Tiffany frequently engages in political commentary herself—often telling customers that business is slow due to “the economy” or “Trump’s tariffs,” blaming broader economic factors for operational issues (such as not being able to afford items like pineapples).
In 2024, when there was a documented E. coli outbreak that led McDonald’s to recall onions in some restaurants, Tiffany repeatedly referenced this recall as justification for changes at Brewability—sometimes exaggerating or misapplying the context and using it to explain supply problems, menu changes, or slow business, regardless of whether it directly applied to Brewability’s own operations.
This pattern of blaming external factors and citing industry events (accurately or not) to excuse internal problems or justify management decisions further demonstrates an inconsistent and self-serving application of workplace policies.




Detailed Narrative
	•	Precipitating event (hat and “inclusivity”):
I wore a Charlie Kirk “Turning Point” hat. Management told me political messages “turn people off” and are not allowed. My intent was not partisan endorsement; it was to stand against celebrating political violence. I pointed out the irony, saying, “It’s the opposite of inclusivity,” which is the establishment’s stated concept and public brand.
	•	Caregiver advocacy and immediate targeting:
My mother—my legal caregiver/advocate/POA—calmly noted the double standard, saying that if I wore a Pride hat I would be celebrated, not censored. Rather than address that inconsistency, Tiffany shifted the conflict onto my mother, treating her presence as the problem and asking whether I’d agree that my mom stop coming inside after drop-off.
	•	Public sit-down in front of customers:
Tiffany sat me down in front of customers and raised the caregiver-ban request. I answered no: if my mom is not welcome, I do not feel welcome, because she is essential to my safety, transportation, medical support, and success at work. I also noted that many other employees’ parents/caregivers regularly come inside; singling out my mother would be inconsistent and discriminatory.
	•	Professional demeanor vs. emotional pressure:
I continued my shift calmly and professionally. I was friendly with Tiffany, even showed her my Sora videos. She remained cold and emotionless. Based on her demeanor and timing, I believe this was designed to manufacture discomfort so I would feel guilty and recant—i.e., emotional manipulation.
	•	Ultimatum delivered minutes before clock-out:
Approximately 10 minutes before my shift ended, Tiffany pulled me aside again—still within earshot/view of customers—and delivered an ultimatum:
	•	Option 1: Keep my schedule only if my mother is barred from coming in, or
	•	Option 2: Have my hours cut to Tuesdays only.
She added, “I’m beginning to see a pattern with your mom, and I don’t want you to follow it,” naming Juliana, Britain, and Nicole (former employees). I reasonably understood this as a veiled threat of future termination if I did not comply.
	•	My response (boundary, principle, and caregiver role):
I told Tiffany: “My mom has been bullied her whole life. I’m not going to tell her that her bully is now my boss and she’s no longer allowed to be part of her son’s workplace.” I reiterated that my mother is my caregiver, advocate, and power of attorney, and I would not exclude her from a major part of my life and work routine.
	•	Immediate consequence (retaliation):
After I refused to exclude my caregiver, my hours were reduced to Tuesdays only. This reduced my weekly hours by the equivalent of the additional days I had been working (e.g., Fridays and Saturdays), causing financial loss and professional harm.
	•	Why this is retaliation and discrimination:
	1.	It followed directly after I expressed a belief (and my caregiver defended me) in response to an unevenly enforced “no politics” rule that does not apply to management’s preferred messaging.
	2.	It punished me for refusing to isolate from my caregiver, despite the fact that numerous other employees’ parents/caregivers are allowed inside.
	3.	It was carried out publicly, causing humiliation and chilling further protected speech/advocacy.
	4.	The reference to a “pattern” tied to former employees, coupled with an ultimatum, is coercive and implies further discipline/termination if I do not conform.

Timeline (concise, investigation-ready)
	•	[Day of incident | Start of shift]: Wore Charlie Kirk/Turning Point hat; told “no politics” because it might “turn people off.” I stated, “That’s the opposite of inclusivity.”
	•	Immediately after: My mother (caregiver/POA) calmly notes hypocrisy (Pride hat would be celebrated).
	•	Same day | Public area: Tiffany sits me down in front of customers; asks if I’ll agree that my mom stop coming inside after drop-off. I refuse; I state caregiver is essential and that other employees’ parents/caregivers regularly come in.
	•	Same day | During shift: I remain professional and friendly (show Sora videos). Tiffany is cold and distant.
	•	~10 minutes before shift end: Tiffany pulls me aside (customers present) and gives the ultimatum: keep schedule only if mom is banned, or be cut to Tuesdays only. She mentions a “pattern” with former employees (Juliana, Britain, Nicole), which I interpret as a threat.
	•	Immediate outcome: I refuse to exclude my caregiver; hours cut to Tuesdays effective immediately.

⸻

Impact
	•	Economic: Loss of shifts beyond Tuesday (e.g., Friday and Saturday), reducing income.
	•	Professional: Public shaming/undermining in front of customers; chilled ability to exercise judgment or speak about policy consistency.
	•	Personal/Safety: Attempt to separate me from my caregiver/advocate/POA, who is critical to my stability, transportation, and medical support.
	•	Pattern Evidence: Singling out my caregiver while allowing other employees’ parents/caregivers to enter; inconsistent application of “no politics” rule (see prior incidents already documented).




Personal Statement and Unreported Background at Brewability

Until now, I remained silent about many of the negatives at Brewability because I truly believed the positives outweighed them—and I genuinely thought Tiffany cared for the individuals she employed. My intent was always to support the mission of inclusion, not to excuse or enable wrongdoing. What changed everything for me was the recent attempt to ban my mother, who is not only my best friend and advocate, but also my legal caregiver.

Banning a caregiver is not just unacceptable—it is unsafe and, in my view, the ultimate form of manipulation. Many of my coworkers cannot communicate their needs or stand up for themselves; for them, a caregiver is often their only voice and protection. Removing that support system is an attempt to gain total control over vulnerable individuals who are already at risk.

What I witnessed in the aftermath of this incident—the retaliation, public humiliation, and ongoing pattern of manipulation and favoritism—made it clear that things are much worse than I ever allowed myself to admit. I am speaking out now because the truth needs to be told, and the safety, dignity, and rights of Brewability’s disabled employees must come before any loyalty to the brand or concept.

This all escalated when I wore a Charlie Kirk “Turning Point” hat to work—not as a partisan statement, but as a way of honoring someone’s life and condemning political violence. Management claimed it was “political” and not allowed, even though similar expressions—such as handing out Kamala Harris hats at Halloween—were openly permitted.
When my mom stood up for me (simply pointing out the hypocrisy that a Pride hat would be celebrated, not censored), Tiffany redirected her anger at my mom instead of me. She then tried to exclude my mother (who is my advocate, caregiver, and best friend) from the premises, falsely claiming no other parents or caregivers come in—when in reality, many do and are much more involved. When confronted with this, Tiffany became visibly angry, drank excessively, and later doubled down on her position rather than reflect or apologize.

Despite the tension, I stood my ground and refused to accept my mom being banned. Ultimately, I was given an ultimatum: either agree to ban my mother from entering, or have my hours cut. I chose to protect my mom and lost two-thirds of my shifts, despite having worked only three days a week.

Tiffany’s pattern of control, retaliation, and manipulation goes far beyond just my situation. She requires full loyalty to her worldview and punishes anyone (disabled or not) who questions her or resists. She uses intimidation tactics, creates a climate where only her favored inner circle is truly accepted, and often abuses her authority—getting drunk at work, exploiting or humiliating vulnerable employees, and showing blatant favoritism.

I have repeatedly witnessed and, at times, intervened when she forced my coworker Jose (who has Down syndrome) to dance against his will—including explicitly sexual “Magic Mike” routines that he has said he doesn’t like. Employees are rarely consulted about whether they are comfortable working certain events, such as drag queen shows involving sexually explicit content, even when many staff have intellectual or developmental disabilities and limited ability to give informed consent or understand what’s appropriate. These situations are not only manipulative but, in my opinion, exploitative and deeply unethical.

Tiffany has also:
	•	Encouraged or enabled alcohol use among disabled employees, disregarding the real risks and consequences.
	•	Gone months without paying staff, and during COVID, misused stimulus funds intended for employees for personal purchases (e.g., buying a boat).
	•	Created a climate of fear and silence, where speaking out leads to retaliation, intimidation, or exclusion from work.


Misuse of COVID Relief Funds Intended for Employee Retention

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Brewability—like many small businesses—received federal relief funds designed to help retain employees, provide direct compensation, and ensure stability for staff during economic hardship.

Tiffany did not distribute any of this relief money to employees. Instead, according to my direct knowledge and accounts from other staff, these funds were used for personal purchases, including buying a boat and soundboard equipment (reportedly for a studio), rather than supporting wages or keeping staff employed as intended by the relief program.

As a result, employees who were meant to be protected by these funds received no financial support, while Brewability’s leadership used the funds for unrelated or self-serving expenses. This action not only violated the intended use of federal aid but contributed to ongoing financial instability and staff hardship at the workplace.

Alcohol Licensing Violations: Illegal Service of Hard Liquor and Wine
Brewability is only licensed to sell beer and malt beverages—it does not have a license to sell or serve hard liquor or wine. Despite this, Tiffany routinely spikes slushie drinks with hard liquor and openly serves boxed wine to customers. These actions are not only illegal but put the business and its employees at significant legal risk, and further illustrate a pattern of disregarding rules, laws, and workplace safety.

Illegal Storage and Consumption of Hard Liquor in Employee Work Areas:
Tiffany routinely stores hard liquor—including cases of moonshine and other spirits—in the beer cooler and her office, both of which are work areas accessed daily by employees with disabilities. She always drinks this alcohol during work hours and provides it to employees during their shifts, openly encouraging them to drink with her. Keeping unlicensed hard liquor in accessible workspaces, and actively promoting on-the-job drinking among vulnerable staff, is not only illegal but creates a hazardous and exploitative work environment.
am sharing these facts now, despite years of silence, because the situation has become intolerable and unsafe—not just for myself, but for my mother and all my coworkers with disabilities. For a long time, I convinced myself that the benefits of this employment opportunity outweighed the negatives. However, Tiffany’s recent attempt to ban a caregiver, combined with everything I have witnessed and learned, has made it clear that the negatives now overwhelmingly surpass any positives. This type of behavior creates an environment that is not only unsafe, but also mentally and emotionally damaging for vulnerable individuals. The abuse, manipulation, and long-term harm caused here cannot be justified or excused. My intent in coming forward is to ensure that the full truth is known and that real accountability and protection for vulnerable employees becomes possible.


Distribution and Encouragement of Marijuana Use Among Employees:
In addition to routinely providing alcohol, Tiffany has also offered marijuana to employees—including adults with disabilities—while at work or during work-related activities. This not only violates workplace safety standards and legal regulations, but also further endangers vulnerable employees and reinforces a pattern of substance encouragement and disregard for their wellbeing.

I also need to report ongoing wage exploitation occurring within Brewability. Managers are illegally tipping themselves out, and at times tipping out select employees in ways that violate tip law. This is not a misunderstanding or one-off mistake. It is consistent enough to form a pattern, and it directly harms employees with disabilities who rely on their wages as their sole source of income.

These actions include:

• Managers taking a portion of tip pools
• Managers distributing tips to themselves
• Managers choosing who receives tips
• Managers withholding tips from some employees
• Managers “adjusting” tip totals without transparency
• Tipping behaviors that do not follow any legal or posted system
• No reliable record-keeping or visibility into where the money goes

This behavior is not permitted under Colorado wage law.
Under Colorado Revised Statutes and Department of Labor standards:

Managers, supervisors, and owners may NEVER take from a tip pool or receive tips from employees they supervise.

Yet it is happening.

For disabled employees, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and do not understand wage law, this is a form of financial exploitation. They are being skimmed from without their knowledge, without the capacity to object, and without meaningful oversight. The individuals losing money cannot advocate for themselves, cannot track discrepancies, and often do not realize when they are being shorted.

Because these employees depend almost entirely on their hourly income and their share of tips, the skimming has a devastating financial impact, and Brewability’s management knows this population is vulnerable, trusting, and unlikely to challenge illegal behavior.

This constitutes:

• Wage theft
• Financial exploitation of vulnerable adults
• Abuse of authority
• Violation of Colorado tip laws
• Unethical and predatory workplace conduct

I believe this must be investigated alongside the other patterns of exploitation already reported.



I am sharing these facts now, despite years of silence, because the situation has become intolerable and unsafe—not just for myself, but for my mother and all my coworkers with disabilities. For a long time, I convinced myself that the benefits of this employment opportunity outweighed the negatives. However, Tiffany’s recent attempt to ban a caregiver, combined with everything I have witnessed and learned, has made it clear that the negatives now overwhelmingly surpass any positives. This type of behavior creates an environment that is not only unsafe, but also mentally and emotionally damaging for vulnerable individuals. The abuse, manipulation, and long-term harm caused here cannot be justified or excused. My intent in coming forward is to ensure that the full truth is known and that real accountability and protection for vulnerable employees becomes possible.
