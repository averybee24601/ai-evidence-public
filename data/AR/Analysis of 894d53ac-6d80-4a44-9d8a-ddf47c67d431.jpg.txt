- File "User's Testimony": Tiffany addressing the user as 'Pam' (the user's mother) in the text message aligns with the user's testimony regarding 'Caregiver advocacy and immediate targeting' and 'Professional demeanor vs. emotional pressure', where Tiffany allegedly redirected conflict onto the user's mother and created discomfort, implying the user lacks independent agency.
- File "User's Testimony": The user mentioning 'Juliana' as an employee who gets called in connects to the 'Ultimatum delivered minutes before clock-out' section of the user's testimony, where Tiffany mentions a 'pattern' with former employees including Juliana.

Full Transcript:
Hey Tiffany, I just wanted to talk to you about something that has been kind of frustrating for me for awhile now. Lately, I've been feeling kind of unappreciated. Not verbally, I feel my work has been appreciated when I am there, and you have been expressing that, it's more in the sense that I feel as if I am overlooked as far as scheduling, and hours go. And In the sense, a lot of employees who have come long after me, have gotten more hours than me, and get called in to be asked to help when it is busy, and I do not. I am wondering, is there something that I did wrong that makes you not want to ask me to work more shifts, or call me on those days you need an extra person? It feels as if Julianna, Stephanie or Rachel, or even Nicole and people who don't work there called even before me. Idk, I guess I was just wondering If there was any reason for that and just wanted to let you know how I felt about that, and I am happy to come in anytime you need me. The end came out wrong, what I meant to say was there a reason you choose to call others in over me? Pam, no. I'm making dough. I have a group in at 3. Everyone's schedules are the same except for mine because I am COOKING
