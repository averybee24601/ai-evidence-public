Summary:

This collection of social media posts and videos demonstrates a pattern of Brewability management publicly promoting and featuring Jose, an employee with Down syndrome, as a special performer in sexually suggestive contexts. Evidence shows Jose performing lap-dance style routines and appearing as a 'guest dancer' at an event involving professional male strippers, directly corroborating the user's testimony regarding the sexual exploitation of a vulnerable adult.

New Findings Summary:
This evidence newly establishes that Jose's sexualized performances were not just internal incidents but were actively and publicly marketed by Brewability through its social media channels. He was advertised as a 'surprise guest dancer' for a male stripper show and a 'special performance' for other events, formalizing his role as sexualized entertainment.

Cross-References:
- File "Magic mike Jose.mp4": The performances in 'jose dancing girls night out.mp4' and 'pony little moses jones.mp4' are consistent with the 'Magic Mike' style lap dance seen in 'Magic mike Jose.mp4'. The use of the same padded muscle shirt across multiple videos establishes a clear pattern of a recurring, sexualized costume for a vulnerable employee.
- File "User Testimony": This batch of evidence directly corroborates the user's testimony that Jose is coerced into performing 'Magic Mike' style dirty dancing routines and is being sexualized. The public promotion of him as a 'special performance' and 'guest dancer' for a stripper show validates the user's claim of exploitation.
- File "IMG_5271.MOV": The audio file 'IMG_5271.MOV' captured Tiffany Fixter planning for Jose to perform for a minor. This batch of videos provides a visual representation of the exact type of sexualized performance she was planning, reinforcing the profound lack of judgment and safeguarding.
- File "video_unauthorized_youtube_footage.mp4": Like the promotional video 'video_unauthorized_youtube_footage.mp4', which showed a lap dance, this evidence demonstrates a continued pattern of recording and publicizing Jose's sexualized performances.
- File "photo_three_people_holiday_costumes_suggestive.png": The padded muscle suit worn by Jose in 'jose dancing girls night out.mp4' is the same or similar to the one seen under his elf costume in the holiday photo, indicating this is a standard, recurring part of his performance attire.

Emotional Analysis:
- Amusement / Excitement: In the video 'jose dancing girls night out.mp4', the female patrons dancing with Jose appear to be smiling, laughing, and actively participating in the performance.
- Uncertain / Performative: Jose's facial expression during the performances in both videos ('jose dancing girls night out.mp4', 'pony little moses jones.mp4') is focused and includes some smiling. However, given the user's testimony of coercion, it is not possible to determine if his apparent engagement is genuine or a result of pressure to perform.

Recognized Employees:
- Jose (at N/A) - 100%
- Jose (at 00:00:01) - 100%

Potential Violations:
- Exploitation of a vulnerable adult
- Failure in Duty of Care
