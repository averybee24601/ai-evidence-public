-------------------------------------
Summary:

The video footage shows an employee identified as Jose, who has Down syndrome, performing a sexually suggestive dance routine for a seated female. The performance includes lap dance movements, floor work, and physical contact. Dollar bills are scattered on the floor around them, and at one point, the female participant sits on Jose's lap, engaging in reciprocal suggestive behavior.

New Findings Summary:
This footage provides visual confirmation of cash tips being thrown on the floor during the performance, directly supporting the allegation that financial incentives are used to motivate this behavior. It also shows the interaction escalating to the guest performing a lap dance on the employee, indicating a lack of boundary enforcement.
