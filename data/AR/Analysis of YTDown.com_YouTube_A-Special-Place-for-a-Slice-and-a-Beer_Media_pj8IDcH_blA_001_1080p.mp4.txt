Summary:

This video is a promotional news segment for "Only Good TV" highlighting Brewability and Pizzability's mission of employing individuals with disabilities. It features interviews with owner Tiffany Fixter and an employee named Aaron Harris, showcasing the work environment and business concept. However, Tiffany Fixter's speech throughout her interview segments is noticeably slurred, and she mispronounces her own business's name, which aligns with user testimony regarding her potential intoxication at work.

New Findings Summary:

(Music begins)
Narrator: Tanner is the head brewer at Brewability, a brewery that's also a pizzeria called Pizzability. You wanna throw some strawberries in the fermenter? What are we doing with all those bubbles? Bubbles and bubbles in there! And he and his staff are serving up something special.
Tanner: It's just a classic American-style pizza. We do a strawberry blonde that's really popular, we're brewing that right now.
Narrator: But what makes this place truly special is who they hire.
Tiffany Fixter: I was a special ed teacher for ten years and I worked with adults with special needs in a day program. And I found that there's not a lot of job opportunities for the kids that I used to teach.
Narrator: So Tiffany opened up Pizzability to give those with disabilities a chance.
Aaron Harris: I'm Aaron Harris. I love this job because I love to work with customers. Scooping gelato, cutting pizzas, and washing dishes.
Tiffany Fixter: We have a lot of non-verbal staff, so we have an iPad that they can use to take your order. We have a pizza menu that's color-coded. So, we've kind of adapted everything to make it so that everybody can do every job in the restaurant. At Brewability and Predictability (sic), our motto is 'brewing abilities'. We wanted to show people that people with disabilities can do more than just three Ds: dishes, dining rooms, and donation centers.
