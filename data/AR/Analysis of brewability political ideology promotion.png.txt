Confidence Score: 95%
Severity Score: 6
Children Detected: No

Key Observations:
- [N/A] The "Brewability & Pizzability" Facebook page posted on February 16, sharing a call for a "24 hour Economic Blackout" on February 28th. This event advocates for specific economic actions and expresses a political viewpoint, stating "Corporations and banks only care about their bottom line" and aiming to "disrupt the economy."
- [N/A] The shared post encourages refraining from purchases at major retailers, fast food, and gas stations, while promoting support for 'small, local businesses'. This implicitly aligns with certain economic and political stances, directly corroborating the user's testimony regarding the promotion of specific political ideologies by management, despite a 'no politics' rule for employees.
- [N/A] The image shows 'Comment as Avery Becker' at the bottom, indicating that Avery Becker is associated with this post as a potential commenter.

Cross-References:
- File "User's Testimony": This image directly supports the user's testimony regarding 'Retaliation and Inconsistent Enforcement of Political Expression and Morality Standards,' specifically that 'management regularly promotes and hosts ideologically aligned events' while restricting employee political expression.
- File "User's Testimony": The content of the economic blackout post, which attributes economic issues to 'corporations and banks,' aligns with the user's testimony that Tiffany frequently engages in 'Political Commentary, Misinformation, and Deflection Using Industry Events' by blaming broader economic factors.

Emotional Analysis:
- Frustration/Targeted Feeling: The promotion of a politically charged event by the employer, while explicitly prohibiting employees from expressing their own political views (as stated in user testimony), could induce feelings of frustration and being unfairly targeted for the user.

Recognized Employees:
- Avery Becker (at N/A) - 99%

Potential Violations:
- Inconsistent Enforcement of Workplace Policy
- Potential Political Discrimination
- Creation of a Hostile Work Environment
