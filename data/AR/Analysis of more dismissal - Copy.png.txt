Full Transcript:
Avery (Jan 19, 2024 at 9:10 AM): Hey Tiffany, I just wanted to write you because I just got a text from Juliana. She told me you asked her to discuss with me, what day of the week this weekend I wanted to work. I just wanted to express my feelings about this, as it has happened multiple times. I feel like this is unfair because I've been working for the last five years these same shifts, and am questioning why I need to choose between the two nights, so somebody who has been there significantly less time than me, can take one of them, from me. I only work three nights a week and they're really important to me. I'm ok this week taking off Saturday but I don't want to have to continually take off one of the nights each weekend. I understand that it is slow, but we have gone through many seasons like this, and I have always worked the same shifts. I also feel, that matters such as scheduling is my decision, and people should not be taking it into their own hands, discussing amongst each other who will work which day, especially if I am unaware if it is true that she was asked to do so. I hope you understand. Tiffany (Jan 19, 2024 at 12:44 PM, message 1): Tuesday, Juliana Wednesday, Thursday and Friday during the day or Saturday, and me during the nights. Tiffany (Jan 19, 2024 at 12:44 PM, message 2): I am not cutting shifts based on seniority. Friday and Saturday nights are not "your shifts" as both of you work them. You said making changes to the schedule is my decision, and you're right, it is, and I am making the decision to cut both of you by one weekend night. Being unwilling to talk to your coworker about what night you prefer will make me remove that option and I will just put you on Saturday nights. And no, Juliana will not be working Thursdays. Again, everyone is getting cut and it's not all fair to cut everyone's shifts but not yours. I can talk to you tonight about what the 2024 plan is and why. I'm sorry you feel its unfair, I am trying to be fair to everyone as much as possible while maintaining operations. Friday and Saturday days are already covered, so that will not work unless there is a large party. Once again, this is temporary until sales go back to normal. I have private event dates I will discuss with you.
