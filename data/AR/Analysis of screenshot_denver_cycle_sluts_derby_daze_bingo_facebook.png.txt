Cross-References:
- File "User's Testimony": This event's '21+' age restriction and association with 'Denver Cycle Sluts' corroborates the user's testimony regarding management's promotion of ideologically aligned or adult-themed events (such as drag-queen bingo with adult-themed prizes) despite the establishment's 'family-friendly' branding.
- File "User's Testimony": The promotion of an event by 'Denver Cycle Sluts' could be seen as an example of inconsistent enforcement of the 'no political messaging' policy, as noted in the user's testimony, where management permits certain ideological expressions while restricting others.
- File "brewability political ideology promotion.png": The presence of 'Comment as Avery Becker' on this post, similar to the 'brewability political ideology promotion.png' file, further indicates Avery Becker's consistent engagement with Brewability's social media presence and content.
