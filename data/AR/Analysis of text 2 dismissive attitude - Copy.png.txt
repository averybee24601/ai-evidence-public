- File "User's Testimony": Avery's frustration about reduced hours and the perceived favoritism towards other employees, particularly regarding long-standing shifts, directly corroborates the user's testimony about experiencing 'Economic: Loss of shifts beyond Tuesday' and 'Professional: Public shaming/undermining in front of customers; chilled ability to exercise judgment or speak about policy consistency' after refusing to comply with management demands, as well as general 'Retaliation and Inconsistent Enforcement'.
- File "User's Testimony": Tiffany's delegation of scheduling decisions to Avery and Juliana reflects the user's testimony about 'inconsistent enforcement' and management's tendency to 'abuse her authority' or create scenarios that cause discomfort, potentially to manipulate outcomes.

Full Transcript:
Avery: Hey Tiffany, I just wanted to write you because I just got a text from Juliana. She told me you asked her to discuss with me, what day of the week this weekend I wanted to work. I just wanted to express my feelings about this, as it has happened multiple times. I feel like this is unfair because I've been working for the last five years these same shifts, and am questioning why I need to choose between the two nights, so somebody who has been there significantly less time than me, can take one of them, from me. I only work three nights a week and they're really important to me. I'm ok this week taking off Saturday but I don't want to have to continually take off one of the nights each weekend. I understand that it is slow, but we have gone through many seasons like this, and I have always worked the same shifts. I also feel, that matters such as scheduling is your decision, and people should not be taking it into their own hands, discussing amongst each other who will work which day, especially if I am unaware if it is true that she was asked to do so. I hope you understand. Tiffany: Avery, my phone was on the stereo/live streaming and I didn't want to text you late after I got home. Yes, I am cutting everyone's shifts in January/February while it has been extremely slow. We are way over staffed. That includes staff that have been with me even longer than you (ie Tony, Nathan, etc) I asked Juliana to see if you wanted Friday or Saturday. It doesn't make sense to have both of you behind the bar on a slow night. It will pick up. I do have private & large events scheduled on some Sundays and opportunities for more tips/work for you. Tuesdays- you Wednesdays - Juliana Thursdays - Steph and Fridays and Saturdays were up to you two to discuss who wants what based on musicians, preferences- which is why I was hoping you both could have a conversation and come to a decision. Avery: I understand that, and agree that cutting staff is definitely necessary this, but taking away my shift, and giving it to Juliana is not solving.
