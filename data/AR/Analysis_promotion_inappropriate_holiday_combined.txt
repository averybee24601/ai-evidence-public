-------------------------------------
Summary:

Brewability & Pizzability, while advertising as a family-friendly establishment that employs adults with disabilities, appears to promote and host sexually explicit, adult-oriented, and politically charged events. This behavior allegedly includes coercing a disabled employee, Jose, into sexualized performances, allowing children at inappropriate events, promoting partisan political ideologies, and retaliating against employees who raise concerns or do not conform. The owner, Tiffany Fixter, is also accused of severe intoxication at work, financial misconduct, and illegal distribution of alcohol and marijuana, creating a hostile and exploitative environment for vulnerable staff.

New Findings Summary:
The new image files provide direct evidence of Brewability promoting 'Sexy Santa' events, explicitly LGBTQ+ events, and linking to 'Denver Cycle Sluts,' an organization accused by a customer of mocking disabilities and causing harm, further substantiating claims of a hostile and inconsistent workplace environment.

Cross-References:
- File "promotion of inappropriate holiday parties around adults with disabilities.png": The promotion of 'Sexy Santa & Sexy Ms. Claus' events aligns with the user's testimony regarding sexually explicit conduct during events and the establishment's inconsistent 'family-friendly' advertising.
- File "ignores concerns.png": The customer review explicitly naming 'Cycle Sluts' as a group that mocked disability and caused harm directly supports the user's testimony about this group's activities and Brewability's promotion of them, as well as the 'hostile environment' claim. This also directly connects to 'screenshot_denver_cycle_sluts_derby_daze_bingo_facebook.png' where 'Denver Cycle Sluts' is a host.
- File "promotion of lgbtq propoganda.png": This post promoting an 'LGBTQ+ and Ally Mixer' corroborates the user's testimony regarding management's regular promotion of 'ideologically aligned events' and 'LGBTQ+ programming' despite a 'no politics' rule for employees, and connects to 'screenshot_denver_pride_checklist_full.png'.
- File "manipulating people into drag shows with charity fundraisers.png": The post featuring the 'DENVER CYCLE SLUTS' logo (dba 'Glitter Goddesses DCS') provides further evidence of Brewability's association with this group, reinforcing the customer's negative review in 'ignores concerns.png' and the user's testimony about inappropriate events and alleged manipulation.
- File "popup queen.png": The promotion of 'Denver Pride' events with drag performers aligns with the user's testimony about management's promotion of LGBTQ+ programming and drag events, which the user stated initially included minors and featured sexually explicit content and prizes.
- File "Magic mike Jose.mp4": The explicit depiction of Jose performing a 'Magic Mike' style routine for a seated woman reinforces the user's testimony about Jose being coerced into sexually suggestive dances against his will, further corroborated by 'photo_person_sitting_on_person_brewability_stage.png' and 'photo_three_people_holiday_costumes_suggestive.png'.
- File "AQPB6JJPK9NNMEUIOSbPAFG2lbQBwOBsUVCLC6K581gVlL6M3eCuEqXJ0AybMRpv4DnZQPcZHQp0__Ez4HqrD64.mp4": Jorge's statement about a daiquiri 'with rum' directly supports the user's testimony regarding illegal service of hard liquor without a proper license.
- File "YTDown.com_YouTube_A-Special-Place-for-a-Slice-and-a-Beer_Media_pj8IDcH_blA_001_1080p.mp4": Tiffany Fixter's slurred speech and mispronunciation of her business's name in this promotional video corroborate the user's testimony about her severe intoxication at work and impairment during business operations.
- File "video_unauthorized_youtube_footage.mp4": This video shows Jose performing a lap dance and a woman dancing on the bar, with a child present, directly supporting the user's testimony about sexually explicit conduct during a religious event and the presence of children, and the unauthorized filming and public misrepresentation to portray the user and his community negatively for objecting.
- File "Retaliatory hours cut due to refusal to ban caregiver - Copy.jpg": This text message exchange directly confirms the user's testimony of being given an ultimatum by Tiffany regarding his caregiver's presence and the subsequent reduction in his work hours, demonstrating retaliation.

Emotional Analysis:
- Distress: User felt 'directly targeted' and 'public embarrassment' from management's actions, and 'acute distress and vulnerability' due to intoxicated management.
- Discomfort: Jose's 'visible discomfort and repeated statements' about performing sexualized routines, and user's 'emotional manipulation' by Tiffany.
- Hostility: Morgan's comment 'This is why I hate Christians', the negative customer review from 'Xtian Gtz' describing a 'hostile' environment for disabled guests, and the user's feeling of being in an 'environment that is hostile toward employees of faith'.
- Fear: User felt 'unable to leave' due to concern for intoxicated management's safety, and perceived 'veiled threat of future termination' from Tiffany's ultimatum.
- Shame: User described a meeting 'intended to shame me' and 'public shaming' in front of customers.
- Powerlessness: Juliana's testimony states Tiffany 'belittles them. She makes them feel powerless and worthless'.
- Anger: Tiffany became 'visibly angry' when confronted about the caregiver ban.

This venue chooses to host the Cycle Sluts, a group that includes members who mocked my disability and contributed to the harm I've experienced. As a deaf customer, I deserve safety, respect, and accessibility, not to walk into a place that platforms people who ridicule and target disabled individuals. On top of that, these same people are tied to ICRME, an organization that has caused me significant harm and has spent months minimizing, rebranding, and covering up what happened instead of taking accountability. Brewability & Pizzability continues to host and uplift the very individuals who were involved in that harm, which makes this space feel unsafe for disabled guests and survivors who just want to enjoy their night without being retraumatized. Until they stop giving a stage to people who discriminate, mock disabilities, and brush off real harm, I cannot support this establishment. DO NOT support this establishment.
