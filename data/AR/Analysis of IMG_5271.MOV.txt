Summary:

This audio file captures a conversation between Brewability owner Tiffany Fixter and the user, Avery Becker. Tiffany asks Avery to verify the age of an expected visitor, an actress with Down syndrome, who she initially believes to be 13 or 15. Upon learning the visitor is 16, Tiffany instructs Avery to ensure that employee Jose, who also has a disability, dances 'for her, but not on her,' indicating a plan to have him perform a known sexualized routine for a minor.

New Findings Summary:
This audio provides direct evidence of management (Tiffany Fixter) planning to have an employee with a disability (Jose) perform a sexualized dance routine for a visiting minor who also has a disability. The conversation reveals a reactive, rather than proactive, approach to safeguarding, with concern only being expressed about physical contact after the minor's age was confirmed as 16.

Confidence Score: 95%
Severity Score: 8.5
Children Detected: No

Key Observations:
- [00:01:09] Tiffany Fixter states her belief that the expected visitor, an actress with Down syndrome, is 'like 13 or 15.' This shows her awareness that she was planning an event involving a minor.
- [00:01:15] Avery Becker confirms to Tiffany that the visitor's age is 16.
- [00:01:17] Immediately after learning the visitor is 16, Tiffany instructs, 'We need to make sure Jose does not dance ON her.' This directly corroborates the user's testimony that the only concern raised was about the physical act of a lap dance, not the inherent inappropriateness of having Jose perform his 'Magic Mike' style routine for a minor with a disability.
- [00:01:21] Tiffany clarifies the instruction: 'Like, he can dance for her, but not on her.' This reinforces the plan to proceed with a modified version of the sexualized performance for the 16-year-old visitor.
