-------------------------------------
Summary:

This collection of evidence shows a clear and consistent pattern of Brewability management publicly promoting and facilitating the sexualized performance of Jose, an employee with Down syndrome. Social media posts from Brewability's official account and patrons advertise Jose as a "special performance" and "surprise guest dancer," including for a ticketed male stripper show. Videos confirm Jose performing lap dances and dancing in a padded muscle suit at these events, strongly corroborating extensive user and witness testimony regarding coercion and exploitation.

New Findings Summary:
This evidence provides direct documentary proof that Brewability's management actively and publicly promoted Jose's sexualized performances on social media. It specifically confirms his participation as a "guest dancer" in a male stripper show and shows him performing a lap dance to the sexually explicit song "Pony," directly linking his performances to the "Magic Mike" theme alleged by the user.

Cross-References:
- File "Magic mike Jose.mp4": The padded muscle suit worn by Jose in `jose dancing girls night out.mp4` is the same type of attire seen in `Magic mike Jose.mp4` and `photo_three_people_holiday_costumes_suggestive.png`, establishing a consistent costume for these sexualized performances.
- File "video_unauthorized_youtube_footage.mp4": The lap dance performance in `pony little moses jones.mp4` is another instance of the same behavior seen in `Magic mike Jose.mp4` and the unauthorized YouTube video, confirming a recurring pattern of this specific type of exploitation.
- File "User's Testimony": The performance to the song "Pony" in `pony little moses jones.mp4` directly corroborates the user's specific claim that Jose was made to perform "'Magic Mike'–style dirty dancing routine... an explicitly sexual dance that included giving lap dances".
- File "EMPLOYEE TESTIMONIES": The public promotion of Jose as a "special performance" and "surprise guest dancer" (`Jose Special Performance.png`, `brewability promotes girls night out.png`) directly supports Juliana's testimony that Tiffany would tell employees "(entertaining is your job)" and the user's testimony about Jose being forced to perform.

Emotional Analysis:
