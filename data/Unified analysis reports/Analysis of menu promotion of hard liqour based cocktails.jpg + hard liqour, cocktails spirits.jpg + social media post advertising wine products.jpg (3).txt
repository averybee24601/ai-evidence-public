-------------------------------------
Summary:

This set of images provides direct visual evidence supporting allegations that the establishment sells and stores hard liquor and wine, potentially violating the scope of a beer and malt-only license. The evidence includes a printed menu listing wine and spirits-based canned cocktails, a storage cart containing bottles of tequila and cases of rum-based spirits, and a social media post explicitly advertising "mulled wine."

New Findings Summary:
The files introduce physical proof of specific high-ABV spirits stored on premises (Herradura Tequila, Grind Espresso Shot) and a printed menu formally offering wine by the glass, corroborating the user's claims of unlicensed sales beyond just beer.

Confidence Score: 100%
Severity Score: 8
Children Detected: No

Key Observations:
- [N/A] In file 'menu promotion of hard liqour based cocktails.jpg', a printed table menu explicitly lists 'Wine' for $8.50, specifying 'White: Sauvignon Blanc', 'Red: Cabernet Sauvignon', and 'Rosé' (13% ABV). This contradicts a beer-only license.
- [N/A] In file 'menu promotion of hard liqour based cocktails.jpg', the menu lists 'Carbliss' at $8/can. Carbliss is typically a vodka or tequila-based ready-to-drink cocktail, falling under spirits, not malt beverages.
- [N/A] In file 'hard liqour, cocktails spirits.jpg', a utility cart in a storage area contains at least two visible 750ml square bottles of 'Herradura Silver Tequila', a distilled spirit.
- [N/A] In file 'hard liqour, cocktails spirits.jpg', the cart contains a 12-bottle case box labeled 'GRIND Espresso Shot', which is a rum-based spirit specialty.
- [N/A] In file 'hard liqour, cocktails spirits.jpg', loose cans of 'Cutwater Tiki Rum Mai Tai' are visible on the cart. Cutwater products are spirits-based cocktails (rum in this instance), not malt beverages.
- [N/A] In file 'social media post advertising wine products.jpg', a Facebook post dated November 25, 2023, explicitly promotes 'warm mulled wine' available for purchase.

Timeline Events:

- File "User Testimony": The images of wine on the menu and the Facebook post confirm the user's testimony regarding the 'Illegal Service of Hard Liquor and Wine.'
- File "User Testimony": The photo of the utility cart with open/loose bottles of tequila supports the user's allegation of 'Illegal Storage... of Hard Liquor in Employee Work Areas.'
