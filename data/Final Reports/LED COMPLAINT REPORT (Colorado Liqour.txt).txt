LED COMPLAINT REPORT (Colorado Liquor Enforcement Division)

Subject: Documented, ongoing unlawful liquor and wine sales by Brewability Lab LLC, supported by photographic evidence and public advertising

To the Colorado Liquor Enforcement Division:

I am submitting a detailed complaint regarding Brewability, located at:

Brewability (Brewability Lab LLC)
3445 S Broadway
Englewood, CO 80113

Before filing this report, I personally verified Brewability’s liquor license status using the Colorado Department of Revenue Liquor License Database.
According to the state’s own records:

Active State License Types for Brewability:

• Manufacturer (Brewery)
• Wholesale Beer (Malt Liquor)

No state license exists for wine, spirits, or a hotel/restaurant/tavern liquor license.
There is no listing allowing the sale of distilled spirits, wine, or spirit-based cocktails of any kind.

Despite that, the establishment has been openly selling, storing, advertising, and serving products outside its legal license category for over a year.

The violations below are supported by photographs, menu documentation, and publicly posted social media.

⸻

1. Violations: Sale of Distilled Spirits (Photographic Evidence Provided)

The following spirit products were found stored and used in service areas:

A. Full case of hard liquor

• A sealed 12-bottle case of Grind Espresso Shot (distilled spirit)
• Multiple opened Grind Espresso Shot bottles
• Half-consumed and empty bottles stored with active inventory

These products are clearly distilled spirits, which cannot legally be sold, stored for sale, or served under a brewery/malt license.

I have photographs showing the sealed case, open bottles, and empty bottles on the premises.

⸻

2. Violations: Sale of Spirit-Based Cocktails (Photographic Evidence Provided)

I photographed multiple ready-to-drink cocktails that contain spirits:

• Cutwater Spirits mixed cocktails
• Carbliss cocktails (vodka-based and tequila-based)
• Tiki Rum Mai Tai canned cocktails

All of these products contain distilled spirits, not malt liquor.
The brewery license does not authorize their sale.

These beverages are stocked and served to customers regularly.

⸻

3. Violations: Sale of Wine (Menu & Social Media Evidence)

The business sells wine openly and consistently.
I have two forms of proof:

A. Printed Menu (Photographed)

The Brewability menu lists:

• Sauvignon Blanc
• Cabernet Sauvignon
• Rosé (13 percent)
• Seasonal wine slushies (8 percent alcohol)

These menu items are offered to customers every day.
They appear on laminated menus placed on the bar.

B. Public Facebook Post (Screenshot Provided)

A Facebook post by “Brewability & Pizzability” advertises:

“Warm mulled wine”
“Come down to Brewability tonight for a great time!!”

This post publicly promotes the sale of wine despite lacking any wine or spirit license at the state level.

Wine cannot legally be served under a brewery manufacturer + wholesale malt license.

⸻

4. Violations: Owner Intoxicated on Duty & Encouraging Staff to Drink

The owner is frequently intoxicated during business hours, while supervising staff and serving customers.
This includes:

• Drinking behind the bar
• Drinking spirit-based beverages stored on site
• Consuming alcohol while supervising disabled adults

She also encourages employees to drink, including employees with:

• Down syndrome
• Autism
• Intellectual and developmental disabilities

These employees require supervision, yet they are being offered or encouraged to drink without regard to:

• Medical history
• Medication interactions
• Judgment or ability to safely consent

This significantly increases the risk of harm.

⸻

5. Vulnerable Adults Endangered

The establishment’s mission is to employ adults with disabilities.
They depend on steady supervision and a safe environment.

Instead, they are being:

• Supervised by an intoxicated manager
• Exposed to illegal alcohol service practices
• Encouraged to consume alcohol
• Placed around hard liquor and spirit products they do not understand

This situation presents a substantial risk to their health, safety, and legal rights.

⸻

6. Duration and Pattern of Misconduct

These actions have not been occasional.
They are routine, ongoing, and have persisted for more than a year.

The presence of:

• A full case of liquor
• Open bottles in active service areas
• Menu listings
• Social media advertising
• Cocktails stored next to beer inventory

…indicates a deliberate and systematic pattern, not an isolated oversight.

⸻

7. Evidence Available for Investigators

I am willing to provide:

• Photos of full liquor bottles
• Photos of empty and half-used spirit bottles
• Photos of Cutwater and Carbliss spirits stored on site
• Photos of the printed menu listing wine and cocktails
• Screenshot of the Facebook post promoting mulled wine
• Photos of the bar and storage areas with spirit bottles present

All evidence was taken inside the establishment.

⸻

8. Requested Actions

I respectfully request that:

• Investigate the sale and service of wine and distilled spirits
• Compare the products sold to Brewability’s limited malt-only license
• Review ownership intoxication while supervising employees
• Evaluate risks posed to disabled workers
• Determine whether these actions constitute willful, repeated violations
• Take any appropriate enforcement action to ensure safety and compliance

I ask that my identity remain confidential due to fear of retaliation.

Thank you for your time and for protecting both public safety and the rights of vulnerable employees.
