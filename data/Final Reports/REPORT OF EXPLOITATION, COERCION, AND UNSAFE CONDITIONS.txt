REPORT OF EXPLOITATION, COERCION, AND UNSAFE CONDITIONS

Brewability – Englewood, Colorado**
Reporter Confidentiality Requested

⸻

1. Overview

This report documents a long, ongoing pattern of exploitation, coercion, unsafe supervision, and exposure to inappropriate sexual and alcohol-related environments involving adults with disabilities at Brewability in Englewood, Colorado.

The affected employees include individuals with:

• Down syndrome
• Autism
• Intellectual disabilities
• Developmental disabilities

These individuals rely on safe supervision and cannot fully recognize manipulation, coercion, or sexual content.
The conduct described has been occurring consistently for approximately five years.

⸻

2. Alcohol-Related Exploitation of Disabled Adults

2.1 Employees are encouraged or pressured to drink alcohol

Examples include:

• Being offered alcohol during work hours
• Being pressured to “drink with the owner”
• Alcohol being normalized as part of the work environment
• Drinking presented as a way to gain approval or belong socially
• No regard for medical risks, medications, or comprehension

Disabled employees lack the capacity to evaluate alcohol-related risks, making this behavior dangerous and exploitative.

⸻

2.2 Drinking is tied to favoritism and social control

A pattern has developed where:

Employees who drink with the owner
• Are given special treatment
• Are invited into her “inner circle”
• Receive more positive attention
• Are rewarded socially or operationally

Employees who refuse alcohol
• Are excluded
• Are treated differently
• Are denied opportunities
• Experience subtle retaliation

This dynamic places disabled adults under coercive pressure to drink.

⸻

2.3 Intoxicated supervision

The owner is frequently intoxicated while supervising employees with disabilities.
This results in:

• Unpredictable supervision
• Lack of safety oversight
• Poor judgment
• Inconsistent instructions
• A hazardous work environment

Supervising vulnerable adults while intoxicated is inherently unsafe.

⸻

3. Exposure to Sexual Content, Adult Materials, and Inappropriate Events

Many events at Brewability include adult content that disabled workers cannot understand or consent to.

Most concerningly, children were allowed at early events where sexual content was present.

⸻

3.1 Minors were allowed at drag events that displayed sexual content

At the first drag events — and possibly several afterward — children were allowed to attend.
These events included:

• Sexual jokes
• Sexual commentary
• Adult themes
• Drag performers showcasing explicit props
• Adult toys displayed on stage
• Genitalia-shaped cakes
• Sexually suggestive conversations

Despite this, both children and disabled adults were present without any protection from the content.

⸻

3.2 Adult materials were handed out in the presence of children and disabled employees

The following occurred at these events:

• Gift bags containing pornographic material were handed out
• Sexualized novelty items were distributed
• I personally received homosexual pornographic content in one such bag
• Disabled adults were present and working during this distribution
• Children were originally permitted in the audience during the early events

This environment is unsafe for both minors and vulnerable disabled adults.

⸻

3.3 Disabled employees were pressured into sexualized performances

Examples include:

• A severely intellectually disabled man being told to perform “Magic Mike”-style dance routines
• Employees pressured to perform in sexually suggestive ways for crowds
• Disabled workers used as entertainment during adult-themed events
• Employees being told participation was part of their “job”

These individuals do not understand the sexual nature of these acts and cannot meaningfully consent.

⸻

4. Coercion, Manipulation, and Social Conditioning

A pattern has formed where disabled adults are conditioned to see harmful or sexualized behavior as normal. This includes:

• Compliance pressured through favoritism
• Unsafe environments presented as routine
• Sexualized events normalized as work
• Discomfort dismissed or ignored
• Employees encouraged to mimic adult behaviors they do not understand

The power dynamic between disabled employees and intoxicated supervisors increases the coercive effect.

⸻

5. Religious Harassment and Pressure to Violate Beliefs

Several disabled employees hold sincere religious beliefs.
During events:

• Christianity was mocked or dismissed
• A Catholic employee was pressured to wear a wig for drag events
• Religious objections were ignored
• Employees were not given alternatives or accommodations
• Refusal to participate was blamed on family members

These individuals cannot fully articulate objections, and their beliefs are not respected.

⸻

6. Lack of Consent, Understanding, and Ability to Report

Employees with intellectual and developmental disabilities:

• Cannot understand sexual content
• Cannot differentiate entertainment from exploitation
• Cannot assess risk
• Cannot recognize coercion
• Often repeat what they believe supervisors want to hear
• Are afraid of losing approval
• Cannot be reliably interviewed about exploitation

Their vulnerability makes exploitation easier to hide.

⸻

7. Long-Term Pattern (Approximately 5 Years)

This includes:

• Pressure to drink
• Intoxicated supervision
• Sexualized events
• Adult material distribution
• Children present during sexual content
• Forced performances
• Disrespect of religious beliefs
• Manipulation of vulnerable adults
• Normalization of unsafe behavior

This is a longstanding, systemic pattern of exploitation and unsafe practices.

⸻

9. Requested APS Actions

I respectfully request APS to:

• Review the safety of the workplace environment
• Evaluate supervisory behavior
• Investigate substance distribution to vulnerable adults
• Examine adult-themed event conduct
• Assess the risk posed to developmentally disabled employees
• Review retaliation against support persons or POAs
• Determine whether protective intervention is required

8.1 Observation of supervisory behavior

• Intoxicated supervision
• Coercion into adult-themed activities
• Pressuring employees to drink
• Disregard for boundaries or beliefs

8.2 Review of event environments

• Event photos
• Social media posts
• Videos
• Adult materials handed out
• Any records of minors present during sexualized content

8.3 Assessment of employee safety

• Determining whether disabled individuals are regularly placed into unsafe or confusing sexualized situations
• Evaluating the basic structure of their working environment

8.4 Intervention or protective oversight

• Safety guidelines

Full confidentiality is requested due to fear of retaliation.
