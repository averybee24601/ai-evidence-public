**FORMAL COMPLAINT TO THE ENGLEWOOD LOCAL LICENSING AUTHORITY

Brewability – 3445 S Broadway, Englewood, CO**
Reporter Confidentiality Requested

⸻

1. Overview

This report details unlawful alcohol service, unsafe supervision, coercive drinking culture, and event-related safety hazards, including minors present during sexualized content, at Brewability in Englewood, Colorado.

The business routinely engages in alcohol practices and event conduct that place disabled employees, minors, and the public at risk.

⸻

2. Unlawful Alcohol Service at the Local Level

Brewability sells:

• Mixed cocktails (Cutwater, Carbliss, Tiki-style canned cocktails)
• Wine
• Wine slushies
• Mulled wine advertised publicly

These beverages are spirit-based or wine-based and are sold daily inside the establishment.

Physical proof includes:

• Photos of stocked canned cocktails
• Photos of wine on the printed menu
• Social media posts advertising mulled wine
• Photos of alcoholic slushie machines

None of this aligns with the alcohol privileges granted at the city level.

⸻

3. Spirits Misused On-Premises (Not Sold, but Consumed Privately)

Although they do not sell bottled spirits such as vodka or whiskey to the public, these products are:

• Stored secretly
• Consumed by the owner during shifts
• Used to drink with disabled employees
• Handed to vulnerable adults to consume socially
• Treated as “staff drinks,” not customer drinks

This creates a dangerous private drinking environment inside a licensed premise.

⸻

4. Intoxicated Supervision of Disabled Employees

The owner routinely supervises employees while intoxicated. Issues include:

• Drinking behind the bar throughout shifts
• Consuming spirit-based beverages while working
• Making managerial decisions while impaired
• Reduced awareness of risks
• No meaningful oversight of vulnerable adults

Given that most employees have intellectual and developmental disabilities, this is a major public safety hazard.

⸻

5. Coercive Drinking Culture Directed at Disabled Adults

Disabled employees are:

• Encouraged to drink alcohol during shifts
• Offered drinks by the owner
• Included socially only if they drink with her
• Excluded or treated coldly if they decline
• Rewarded with special treatment if they participate

Alcohol is used as a social lever and control mechanism.

Employees cannot fully understand:

• Alcohol’s effects
• Medication interactions
• Impaired consent
• Long-term risks

This is coercive and unsafe.

⸻

6. Minors Present During Sexualized Events (Critical Safety Violation)

During earlier drag-themed events, Brewability allowed children to attend, even though the events included:

• Sexual jokes
• Sexual humor
• Adult discussions
• Explicit props
• Genitalia-shaped cakes
• Sexualized performance themes
• Distribution of adult-themed items

Disabled adults were working these events, and minors were present.

This is a direct violation of appropriate public event standards and raises serious concerns about event oversight and community safety.

⸻

7. Adult Items Distributed in the Presence of Disabled Adults and Minors

During these events:

• Gift bags containing pornographic material were handed out
• Sexualized items were shared by performers
• Disabled employees were on shift during these handouts
• Children were initially permitted to attend these shows

This environment was unsafe for both minors and vulnerable adults.

⸻

8. Disabled Adults Used as Sexualized Entertainment

Over several years, disabled employees have been:

• Encouraged to perform sexually suggestive routines
• Told these performances were part of their job
• Used as entertainment for crowds
• Guided into adult-themed roles they cannot understand
• Placed in sexualized contexts without consent

This includes an intellectually disabled male employee by the name of Jose being instructed to perform dance routines such as “Magic Mike.”

This is exploitation inside a business operating under Englewood’s authority.



**ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES REPORT

Exploitation, Coercion, Substance Distribution, Sexual Exposure, and Retaliation
Brewability – 3445 S Broadway, Englewood, CO**
Reporter Confidentiality Requested

⸻

1. Summary of Allegations

This report documents a multi-year pattern of exploitation, coercion, unsafe supervision, sexual exposure, substance distribution, and retaliatory behavior involving developmentally and intellectually disabled adults employed at Brewability.

Affected employees include individuals with:

• Down syndrome
• Autism
• Intellectual disabilities
• Developmental disabilities
• Chronic medical conditions
• Limited comprehension or communication abilities

These individuals depend on safe supervision and protection. Instead, they are repeatedly placed in environments involving adult content, alcohol, drugs, and unsafe supervisory behavior they cannot understand or consent to.

⸻

2. Alcohol-Related Exploitation

2.1 Disabled employees encouraged to drink alcohol

Employees with disabilities are:

• Offered alcohol during work
• Encouraged to drink socially with the owner
• Given the impression drinking earns favor
• Treated differently or excluded if they refuse

This places vulnerable adults in unsafe situations they cannot evaluate.

⸻

2.2 Owner drinks while supervising disabled staff

The owner:

• Consumes alcohol while working
• Drinks behind the bar
• Supervises employees while visibly intoxicated
• Engages in managerial decisions while impaired

For disabled employees who rely on consistent oversight, this creates significant safety hazards.

⸻

2.3 Spirits consumed with disabled employees

Although spirits are not sold to customers, the establishment keeps them on-site and the owner:

• Consumes them privately
• Shares or offers them to disabled employees
• Normalizes hard alcohol consumption in the workplace

This constitutes distribution of hard alcohol to adults with cognitive impairments.

⸻

3. Marijuana Offered to Employees with Disabilities

The owner has offered marijuana to developmentally disabled employees.

This includes:

• Offering marijuana casually
• Treating marijuana as a social bonding tool
• Disregarding employees’ medical needs, medications, or comprehension
• Exposing disabled adults to illegal or unsafe drug use expectations

Offering marijuana to individuals with significant cognitive limitations is dangerous and constitutes exploitation.

⸻

4. Sexual Exposure and Inappropriate Event Content

4.1 Minors present during sexualized drag events

In earlier drag-themed events, children were allowed to attend despite:

• Sexual jokes
• Explicit humor
• Adult props
• Genitalia-shaped cakes
• Sexual innuendo
• Sexualized performances

Disabled employees were working during these events and could not comprehend the adult nature of the environment.

⸻

4.2 Adult items and pornography distributed

During events:

• Gift bags containing pornographic material were handed out
• Sexualized props were displayed or distributed
• Disabled employees were working at the time
• Children had been permitted at these events

This created unsafe conditions for both minors and disabled adults.

⸻

4.3 Disabled adults coerced into sexually suggestive performances

Employees with intellectual disabilities have been:

• Encouraged to perform sexually suggestive dance routines
• Told that these performances were part of their job
• Used as entertainment
• Placed in adult-themed roles without comprehension

One severely intellectually disabled male employee was pressured to do “Magic Mike” style routines despite expressing discomfort.

This is sexual exploitation.

⸻

5. Coercion, Manipulation, and Harmful Conditioning

Disabled employees have been subjected to:

• Social pressure to engage in unsafe behaviors
• Reward systems tied to alcohol or inappropriate participation
• Emotional manipulation
• Normalization of adult content and substance use
• Exposure to behaviors beyond their comprehension
• Environments where boundaries and safety are not enforced

This conditioning erodes their ability to recognize exploitation.

⸻

6. Retaliation Against Disability Advocacy

The owner attempted to ban my caregiver and legal power of attorney (POA).

My POA is responsible for:

• My medical communication
• Disability advocacy
• Safety decisions
• Navigating accommodations due to autism and chronic medical issues

Attempting to remove a disabled employee’s advocate or POA from the premises demonstrates:

• Intent to isolate vulnerable individuals
• Control over disabled employees’ access to support
• Retaliation when concerns are raised
• Disregard for protections required under disability law

This behavior shows an alarming willingness to suppress outside oversight and leave disabled workers defenseless.

⸻

7. Lack of Consent and Capacity

Employees with intellectual and developmental disabilities:

• Cannot understand adult sexual material
• Cannot evaluate substance use
• Cannot comprehend risks
• Do not recognize exploitation
• May comply automatically with supervisor expectations
• Cannot protect themselves
• Cannot meaningfully consent to adult-themed events or alcohol/drug use

These vulnerabilities make the ongoing behavior extremely dangerous.

⸻

8. Multi-Year Pattern of Abuse

Over approximately five years, Brewability has engaged in:

• Pressuring disabled adults to drink
• Offering marijuana to disabled employees
• Using spirits privately with vulnerable workers
• Intoxicated supervision
• Adult-themed events unsafe for disabled adults
• Allowing minors at events with sexual content
• Distributing pornographic items during business operations
• Coercing disabled adults into sexualized performances
• Favoritism tied to participation in adult behaviors
• Retaliation against advocates
• Conditioning disabled workers to view exploitation as normal

This is not isolated misconduct — it is a systemic pattern of unsafe, abusive, and exploitative behavior.

⸻

9. Requested APS Actions

I respectfully request APS to:

• Review the safety of the workplace environment
• Evaluate supervisory behavior
• Investigate substance distribution to vulnerable adults
• Examine adult-themed event conduct
• Assess the risk posed to developmentally disabled employees
• Review retaliation against support persons or POAs
• Determine whether protective intervention is required

Confidentiality is critical due to fear of retaliation.



⸻

9. Hostile and Unsafe Workplace Conditions

Patterns include:

• Intoxicated supervision
• Pressure to drink
• Favoritism tied to alcohol participation
• Sexualized events
• Minors exposed to adult content
• Disabled adults placed in adult-themed environments
• Adult pornography distributed during business operations

These behaviors have taken place consistently for approximately five years.

⸻

10. Requested City Actions
