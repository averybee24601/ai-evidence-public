=====================================================================================================
CHRONOLOGICAL TIMELINE OF SYSTEMATIC EXPLOITATION
BREWABILITY WORKPLACE - 2018 TO 2025
=====================================================================================================

This timeline demonstrates how exploitation and abuse escalated over 7 years, with a clear pattern of
removing protective oversight, exploiting vulnerable employees, crushing resistance, and using the
"inclusive mission" as cover.

=====================================================================================================
2018-2020: EARLY PATTERNS ESTABLISH
=====================================================================================================

ONGOING (Juliana's Testimony):
"Every shift I worked Tiffany was always drunk. There's not been a day or a time I can recall that she
wasn't drinking."

[Date Unknown - Early Employment]
EVENT: Religious targeting begins
- Manager Alyse places "Black Jesus" figurines behind bar, directly at Avery's workspace
- Pattern of religious mockery established
SIGNIFICANCE: Demonstrates early targeting based on faith

[Date Unknown - During Juliana's Employment]
EVENT: Sexual assault and victim-blaming
- Tiffany's boyfriend (brewer) gropes Juliana
- When Juliana reports: Tiffany responds "Do you blame him? Have you seen yourself?"
- Juliana later fired "due to rumors and accusations of sexual assault"
SIGNIFICANCE: Establishes pattern - report misconduct → victim blamed → terminated

[May 25, 2020]
EVENT: Byron Williams safety advocacy begins
- Byron Williams (former job coach for people with disabilities) places signs: "Alcohol and Autism
  Don't Mix - What message do we send?"
- Security footage shows him placing signs near establishment
SIGNIFICANCE: External safety advocate recognizes concerning pattern

=====================================================================================================
MAY 2021: DEFAMATION OF SAFETY ADVOCATE
=====================================================================================================

[May 28, 2021]
EVENT: Public defamation campaign against Byron Williams
- Brewability & Pizzability posts to Facebook naming Byron Williams
- Post states he "has admitted to writing the messages AND he will not stop"
- Accuses him of "taunting our business"
- States "A restraining order has been filed"
- Publicly suggests Williams needs "support from a mental health professional"
- Post remains public, visible to entire community

SIGNIFICANCE: Pattern established - Anyone who raises safety concerns about vulnerable adults + alcohol
→ Publicly attacked, defamed, and silenced. Chilling effect on future advocates.

=====================================================================================================
2021-2022: EXPLOITATION PATTERNS INTENSIFY
=====================================================================================================

[Ongoing - Juliana's Employment Period]
EVENT: Routine abandonment of vulnerable employees
Juliana: "I received a call on one of my scheduled shift days... one of my coworkers informed me 'Tiffany's
passed out' and it had been brought to my attention that Tiffany left employees who were lower functioning,
autism, and other disabilities alone while she was passed out, drunk in front of customers"

EVENT: Regular tip theft
Juliana: "There has been many shifts, especially on the weekends, where Tiffany made it so she was the
only one that could tip her employees out, but during those shifts, she was so drunk and couldn't so I
have gone a night without being tipped out"

EVENT: Coerced performances
Juliana: "Keeping a staff member who has down syndrome late so he could dance for her drunk friends"

EVENT: Self-tipping
Juliana: "I have seen her tip herself and her business partner out at the end of a shift"

EVENT: Drunk driving with employees
Juliana: "Tiffany has driven me home drunk on more than one occasion"

SIGNIFICANCE: With Juliana later terminated, no accountability for any of these incidents. Pattern of
eliminating witnesses allows escalation.

=====================================================================================================
FEBRUARY 2023: DOUBLING DOWN ON ALCOHOL PROMOTION
=====================================================================================================

[February 13, 2023]
EVENT: Economic Blackout political promotion shared

[February 15, 2023]
EVENT: Public dismissal of Byron Williams concerns (2 years later)
- Brewability & Pizzability posts Byron Williams' sign to Facebook
- Tiffany Fixter's caption: "Adults with and without disabilities have the right to choose"
- Calls Williams' concern "narrow minded opinion" and "hate"
- Defends alcohol access for adults with disabilities despite safety concerns

SIGNIFICANCE: 2 years after restraining order, still publicly attacking safety advocate. Demonstrates
entrenched position on alcohol despite concerns from disability professionals.

=====================================================================================================
2024: CHRISTIAN CHURCH PARTY - ESCALATION & DOCUMENTATION
=====================================================================================================

[Date Unknown - 2024]
EVENT: Christian church party intentionally disrupted
- Avery books Brewability for church worship band birthday party
- Event intentionally double-booked with sexually explicit entertainment
- Female performers give lap dances and "strip-style behavior on the bar"
- Manager Alyse wears shirt: "Jesus Is Rizzen" (mocking "Jesus Is Risen") - Tiffany laughs
- Children are present during sexual performances
- Worship band forced to wait while sexual performances occur
- Mother objects to inappropriateness given children present
- Morgan responds: "This is why I hate Christians" (direct religious discrimination)
- Management films entire incident without consent
- Later publishes video to YouTube framing Avery's church as "villains"

Video Content [video_unauthorized_youtube_footage.mp4]:
[00:00:48] Tiffany: "We're ready to go, we will stab any one of you" (violent threat)
[00:01:21] Shows Jose performing lap dance
[00:01:24] Shows woman dancing on bar with money in her shorts
[00:01:26] CHILD VISIBLY PRESENT during sexual performance
[00:01:28] Tiffany voiceover: "Because his party went over, half his people left, and his church is
            really angry and we've embarrassed his family" (admits intentional provocation)
[00:01:36] Jacob: "There's always got to be a good guy, and there's always got to be a villain"
            (narrative framing church as antagonists)
[00:01:42] Aaron: "I wonder if I'm going to have a job pretty soon" (manipulative, using vulnerable
            employee to generate sympathy)
[00:02:11] Jose and Rachel in wrestling ring, scripted romantic rejection causing Jose visible distress

SIGNIFICANCE: Multiple violations in single incident - child endangerment, religious discrimination,
sexual exploitation of Jose (documented), unauthorized filming, public defamation. Management deliberately
provokes Christian employee, then films and publishes the conflict to portray victims as villains.

=====================================================================================================
LATE 2024: PRE-ELECTION POLITICAL TARGETING
=====================================================================================================

[Shortly Before November 2024 Election]
EVENT: Kamala Harris sticker distribution
- Management places Kamala Harris campaign stickers in public restroom
- Encourages customers to take and wear them
- Directly contradicts claimed "no politics" policy
- Occurs while Avery (known Republican) is employed

SIGNIFICANCE: Establishes selective enforcement - left-leaning political expression encouraged while
conservative expression will be banned (see upcoming October 2025 incident).

=====================================================================================================
OCTOBER 2025: STRIP CLUB INCIDENT
=====================================================================================================

[Late October 2025]
EVENT: Strip club outing organized for employees with developmental disabilities
- Tiffany proposes and organizes off-site visit to strip club
- Multiple employees with developmental/intellectual disabilities taken
- At least one individual tips performer excessively
- Tiffany/management pays resulting bill
- No documented guardian/caregiver consent
- No risk assessment conducted
- Foreseeable financial exploitation occurred

SIGNIFICANCE: Pattern of exposing vulnerable employees to sexually explicit environments. Demonstrates
lack of appropriate safeguarding. Financial exploitation predictable and preventable.

=====================================================================================================
OCTOBER-NOVEMBER 2025: THE HAT INCIDENT - RETALIATION CASCADE
=====================================================================================================

[Day 1 - October/November 2025]
**START OF SHIFT:**
EVENT: Charlie Kirk hat worn
- Avery wears Charlie Kirk "Turning Point" hat to work
- Intent: Condemn political violence, honor Charlie Kirk's life (murdered)
- Management: "Political messages not allowed because they turn people off"
- Avery: "That's the opposite of inclusivity"

**IMMEDIATELY AFTER:**
EVENT: Mother's advocacy triggers targeting
- Avery's mother (legal caregiver/POA) calmly notes hypocrisy
- Points out: If Pride hat, would be celebrated not censored
- Tiffany redirects anger from Avery to his mother

**PUBLIC AREA - CUSTOMERS PRESENT:**
EVENT: First caregiver ban attempt
- Tiffany sits Avery down in public
- Asks if he'll agree that mother stops coming inside after drop-off
- Avery refuses: "If my mom is not welcome, I do not feel welcome"
- Avery notes other employees' parents/caregivers regularly come in
- Avery states mother essential for safety, transportation, medical support

**DURING SHIFT:**
EVENT: Psychological manipulation attempt
- Avery remains professional and friendly
- Even shows Tiffany Sora videos
- Tiffany remains "cold and emotionless"
- Apparent attempt to manufacture discomfort/guilt

**~10 MINUTES BEFORE SHIFT END - CUSTOMERS PRESENT:**
EVENT: Ultimatum delivered
- Tiffany pulls Avery aside (still in earshot/view of customers)
- OPTION 1: Keep schedule (Tue/Fri/Sat) ONLY IF mother barred from premises
- OPTION 2: Hours cut to Tuesdays only
- Adds: "I'm beginning to see a pattern with your mom, and I don't want you to follow it"
- Names Juliana, Britain, Nicole (all terminated former employees)
- Veiled termination threat

**AVERY'S RESPONSE:**
EVENT: Boundary set, principle stated
- "My mom has been bullied her whole life. I'm not going to tell her that her bully is now my boss
   and she's no longer allowed to be part of her son's workplace."
- Reiterates mother is caregiver, advocate, POA
- Will not exclude her from major part of life and work

**IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE:**
EVENT: Retaliation - hours cut
- Hours reduced from Tue/Fri/Sat → Tuesday only
- 67% reduction in weekly hours
- Immediate financial loss
- Professional harm

SIGNIFICANCE: This sequence demonstrates the complete pattern:
1. Conservative/religious expression → Banned (double standard)
2. Caregiver advocates for employee → Targeted for removal
3. Employee refuses to comply → Economic retaliation
4. Public delivery of ultimatum → Humiliation, chilling effect
5. Veiled termination threat → Coercion

[Days Following]
EVENT: Text message exchange confirming retaliation

Avery: "I want to confirm. I'm not working Fridays and Saturdays from this day forward?"
Tiffany: "Your options are: to continue your normal schedule (Tues,Fri,Sat) and get dropped off and picked
          up OR you just work Tuesdays 3-9. Yes, this was discussed."
Avery: "I'm choosing Tuesday, because I'm not going to tell my mom she isn't welcome at my workplace. She's
        my advocate and caregiver, and I won't cut her out of a major part of my life where I want her to
        be included."
Tiffany: "Ok. See you Tuesdays."

EVIDENCE FILE: Retaliatory hours cut due to refusal to ban caregiver - Copy.jpg
CONFIDENCE: 100% | SEVERITY: 9/10
AI ANALYSIS: "This text message exchange directly corroborates the user's testimony detailing Tiffany's
ultimatum regarding banning the caregiver and the subsequent reduction of work hours to 'Tuesdays only'
as a direct consequence of the user's refusal."

=====================================================================================================
NOVEMBER 2025: DECISION TO COME FORWARD
=====================================================================================================

[November 6-10, 2025]
EVENT: Evidence collection and analysis
- Avery compiles 7 years of evidence
- Creates AI Evidence Companion system to analyze files
- Gathers videos, photos, text messages, social media posts
- Documents testimonies (personal and Juliana's)
- 19+ multimedia files analyzed with 95-100% confidence scores

[November 15, 2025]
EVENT: Comprehensive report completed
- Full analysis of all evidence
- Pattern identification across 7 years
- Legal violations documented
- Regulatory recommendations prepared

Avery's Statement:
"For a long time, I convinced myself that the benefits of this employment opportunity outweighed the
negatives. However, Tiffany's recent attempt to ban a caregiver, combined with everything I have witnessed
and learned, has made it clear that the negatives now overwhelmingly surpass any positives. This type of
behavior creates an environment that is not only unsafe, but also mentally and emotionally damaging for
vulnerable individuals. The abuse, manipulation, and long-term harm caused here cannot be justified or
excused. My intent in coming forward is to ensure that the full truth is known and that real accountability
and protection for vulnerable employees becomes possible."

=====================================================================================================
PATTERN PROGRESSION SUMMARY
=====================================================================================================

PHASE 1: ESTABLISH CONTROL (2018-2020)
→ Constant intoxication of management
→ Religious/political targeting begins
→ Vulnerable employees coerced into performances
→ Witnesses (Juliana) report misconduct

PHASE 2: ELIMINATE OVERSIGHT (2020-2021)
→ External advocate (Byron Williams) publicly defamed
→ Restraining order filed against safety advocate
→ Witnesses (Juliana) terminated after reporting
→ Pattern of retaliation established

PHASE 3: NORMALIZE EXPLOITATION (2021-2023)
→ Routine tip theft when management intoxicated
→ Coerced performances become regular
→ Substance encouragement (alcohol/marijuana)
→ Public defense of alcohol access despite safety concerns

PHASE 4: ESCALATE VIOLATIONS (2024-2025)
→ Sexual performances with children present
→ Strip club outing for vulnerable employees
→ Intentional religious provocation (church party disruption)
→ Unauthorized filming and public defamation

PHASE 5: FINAL CONTROL ATTEMPT (October-November 2025)
→ Attempt to ban last protective caregiver
→ Economic retaliation (67% hours cut)
→ Veiled termination threat
→ Whistleblower comes forward with evidence

=====================================================================================================
THE PATTERN IS CLEAR
=====================================================================================================

YEAR BY YEAR, THE SAME PROGRESSION:

1. Vulnerable employees exploited
2. Someone tries to protect them (Juliana, Byron Williams, Avery's mother)
3. That person is attacked, defamed, and removed
4. Exploitation continues unchecked
5. Pattern repeats

With each eliminated advocate, control over vulnerable employees increases.

The attempted caregiver ban in October/November 2025 represents the final step: eliminate the last
remaining voice protecting employees who cannot protect themselves.

=====================================================================================================
WHAT HAPPENS WITHOUT INTERVENTION
=====================================================================================================

Based on 7-year pattern:

IMMEDIATE FUTURE:
→ Jose continues being coerced into sexual performances (documented pattern)
→ Other employees' caregivers targeted for ban (precedent set)
→ Financial exploitation continues (tip theft, wage delays)
→ Management intoxication endangers employees (documented pattern)
→ No oversight, no accountability, no protection

LONG-TERM:
→ More vulnerable employees recruited into exploitative environment
→ "Inclusive mission" continues as PR shield
→ Witnesses intimidated into silence (seen consequences)
→ Abuse normalizes further (employees "feel... it's normal" per Juliana)
→ Potential life-threatening consequences (medical emergency with no sober supervision)

=====================================================================================================
WHY AVERY CAME FORWARD NOW
=====================================================================================================

Avery worked there for 7 years. He witnessed exploitation for years. Why speak up now?

The caregiver ban attempt crossed a line.

Avery: "Banning a caregiver is not just unacceptable—it is unsafe and, in my view, the ultimate form of
manipulation. Many of my coworkers cannot communicate their needs or stand up for themselves; for them,
a caregiver is often their only voice and protection. Removing that support system is an attempt to gain
total control over vulnerable individuals who are already at risk."

Without caregivers:
- Jose has no one to say "Stop making him do sexual dances"
- Employees with autism have no one to notice when they're being financially exploited
- No one can intervene in medical emergencies when management is passed out drunk
- No one documents what happens behind closed doors

The pattern shows: Once oversight is gone, exploitation escalates.

This isn't about Avery's job. This is about what happens to Jose, Rachel, Aaron, and every other
vulnerable employee when no one is watching.
