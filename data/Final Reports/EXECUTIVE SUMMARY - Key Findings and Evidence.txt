3. SYSTEMATIC CAREGIVER BAN = ELIMINATION OF OVERSIGHT
   Severity: 9/10 | Evidence: Text messages, testimony
   - Employee's mother (legal caregiver/POA) targeted for ban after defending son
   - Hours cut 67% (Tue/Fri/Sat → Tue only) as retaliation for refusing to ban caregiver

   - Routine tip withholding when management too intoxicated to pay out
   - Months-long wage delays
   - Arbitrary tip distribution favoring owner's drinking buddies

5. INTOXICATED MANAGEMENT ABANDONING VULNERABLE EMPLOYEES
   Severity: 9.5/10 | Evidence: Multiple witness accounts
   - Owner passed out drunk, leaving employees with autism/Down syndrome alone
   - No sober supervisor present
   - No emergency protocols
   - Life-threatening safety risk

=====================================================================================================
THE PATTERN: HOW EXPLOITATION WORKS
=====================================================================================================

STEP 1: ISOLATE FROM PROTECTION
→ Ban caregivers who advocate for employees
→ Fire witnesses who report misconduct (Juliana, Britain, Nicole)
→ Defame external safety advocates (Byron Williams)
→ Selective "no politics" rule to silence protective voices

STEP 2: EXPLOIT VULNERABLE EMPLOYEES
→ Coerce into sexual performances ("it's your job")
→ Take to strip clubs without guardian consent
→ Pressure to drink alcohol/use marijuana
→ Frame degrading acts as "entertainment" or "job duties"

STEP 3: FINANCIAL CONTROL
→ Withhold tips through deliberate intoxication
→ Steal federal relief funds
→ Delay wages for months
→ Favor compliant employees in pay

STEP 4: CRUSH RESISTANCE
→ Retaliate against anyone who objects (hours cut, termination, public shaming)
→ Create fear: "I'm beginning to see a pattern... I don't want you to follow it" (threat)
→ Make example of whistleblowers

STEP 5: PR COVER
→ Market as "inclusive" and "family-friendly"
→ Use mission to deflect criticism
→ Portray critics as attacking disabled employment

=====================================================================================================
WHY VULNERABLE EMPLOYEES CANNOT SELF-ADVOCATE
=====================================================================================================

1. COGNITIVE LIMITATIONS → May not recognize they're being exploited
2. POWER IMBALANCE → Employer has absolute authority
3. COMMUNICATION BARRIERS → Cannot articulate concerns
4. NORMALIZED ABUSE → "They feel... how they're being treated is normal" -Juliana
5. ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE → Need job for survival, limited alternatives
6. RETALIATION FEAR → Witnessed others fired for speaking up
7. CAREGIVER BAN → Protective oversight systematically removed

Juliana: "Tiffany has such a power over them that they feel what they're given and being treated and
how they're being treated is normal, but it's not. It's despicable."

Avery: "Many of my coworkers cannot communicate their needs or stand up for themselves; for them, a
caregiver is often their only voice and protection. Removing that support system is an attempt to gain
total control over vulnerable individuals who are already at risk."

=====================================================================================================
IMMEDIATE DANGER SCENARIOS WITHOUT CAREGIVER OVERSIGHT
=====================================================================================================

SCENARIO: Medical Emergency
Jose has allergic reaction → Cannot communicate symptoms → Management passed out drunk → Caregiver banned
from premises → No one can provide medical history or consent to treatment → LIFE-THREATENING DELAY

SCENARIO: Continued Sexual Exploitation
Jose told to perform lap dance → Says "I don't like it" → No caregiver present to intervene → Told "it's
your job" → Coerced performance continues → No documentation, no protection, no accountability

SCENARIO: Financial Abuse
Jose not tipped out multiple shifts → Cannot calculate missing wages → Cannot confront management →
Caregiver who reviews pay stubs is banned → Theft continues indefinitely

SCENARIO: Substance Pressure
Jose pressured to drink alcohol → Without caregiver awareness, medication interactions unknown → Risk
of dependency → Family has no knowledge until serious consequences

=====================================================================================================
WHAT MAKES THIS CASE DIFFERENT
=====================================================================================================

This is NOT just "bad management" or "isolated incidents."

This is SYSTEMATIC exploitation with a deliberate pattern:
1. Remove protective oversight (ban caregivers, fire witnesses)
2. Exploit isolated vulnerable employees (sexual performances, substance pressure)
3. Steal their wages (tips, relief funds)
4. Crush any resistance (retaliation, defamation)
5. Use "inclusive mission" as PR shield

The owner has weaponized the very concept of "employing people with disabilities" to:
- Deflect criticism ("you're attacking our mission!")
- Gain public sympathy
- Access vulnerable individuals
- Eliminate oversight under guise of "independence"

Juliana: "She uses the concept of [what] Brewability is supposed to stand for to make her look good
when in all reality she manipulates, uses and takes advantage of her staff."

=====================================================================================================
WHAT REGULATORY AGENCIES SHOULD DO IMMEDIATELY
=====================================================================================================

1. ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES
   → Welfare check on ALL employees with intellectual/developmental disabilities
   → Assess for exploitation, coercion, sexual abuse
   → Interview with specialists in alternative communication

2. LABOR BOARD
   → Investigate wage theft (tip withholding, delayed wages)
   → Investigate retaliation (caregiver ban → hours cut)
   → Assess hostile work environment

3. LIQUOR LICENSING BOARD
   → Immediate inspection
   → Review illegal hard liquor service
   → Assess intoxicated management operating licensed establishment

4. CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES
   → Investigate child endangerment (sexual performances with minors present)
   → Review "family-friendly" marketing vs. actual 21+ adult content

5. IRS/FEDERAL
   → Investigate COVID relief fund misuse (allegedly used for boat purchase)
   → Trace federal funds

6. LAW ENFORCEMENT
   → Criminal coercion investigation
   → Controlled substance distribution (marijuana to employees)
   → Fraud charges (relief funds)

=====================================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE
=====================================================================================================

Brewability presents itself as an inclusive workplace empowering people with disabilities.

The evidence shows it is actually a system of exploitation where:
- The most vulnerable adults in society are manipulated, their only defenses / voices are silenced, and the compromised individuals are sexually exploited
- Children are endangered
- Federal relief money is stolen
- Anyone who tries to protect these employees is destroyed

The attempted caregiver ban is the final piece: eliminate the last voice protecting people who cannot
protect themselves.

This is not about Avery Becker's job. This is about Jose being forced to perform lap dances. This is
about Rachel being posed suggestively. This is about employees with autism being left alone with
management passed out drunk. This is about what happens when no one is watching.

Avery Becker: "My intent in coming forward is to ensure that the full truth is known and that real
accountability and protection for vulnerable employees becomes possible."

Juliana: "I didn't like going into work anymore, but I did it to protect and be there for my coworkers
who didn't have a voice and couldn't stand up for themselves."

The question is: Who will be the voice now?
